Exploratory analysis of seismic data using R and RStudio

This is preliminary work on publicly available seismic surveys. The concept is to explore ways that this data can be utilized and leveraged in R to conduct unique analysis and potentially find new ways to scan existing surveys and leverage existing public information.  

The end goal would be to be able to scan surveys and identify patterns that could be missed due to limited Engineer capacity.
